# state space formation: S0 SF SP SR
# lambda = 1/(12*30*24) = 0.000115741 --> MTBF is 12 months
# r1 = 2 --> it takes 7 days to recover from an unexpected failure
# r2 = 1/(7*24) = 0.005952381 --> this is the base longevity interval (from S0 to SP), equal to 7 days
# r3 = 3 --> the mean repair time after rejuvenation is 20 min
# r4 = 1/((14-7)*24) = 0.005952381
