# Challenges

I have put all code in the folder `challenges`. There are two sub-folders in there:
1. `project00`: contains all challenges using Makefile and `defs.h` (to ease programming).
2. `project01`: a full project with all possibilities as discussed in the book.

The decision to make `project00` and congregate all code stems from the fact that I would like to have ONE SINGLE place to withold all functions.
So, in the eventuality of me (or other people) finding bugs, one will fix in only one place, not across many multiple challenges.
